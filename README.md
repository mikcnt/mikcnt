### Hey everybody üññ

I'm Michele Conti, MSc student in computer science @ La Sapienza, Rome.

I'm mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning, but I honestly love learning new things in general. Computer science is obviously not the only interest I've got, I'm also interested in mathematics (for which I've got a bachelor degree üéì).

I love Python. I love papers written with LaTeX. I hate ugly things.
### What I'm working on üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
I'll keep here a short list of interesting projects I've been working (or I'm still working) on:

* [Image colorization with Deep Learning](https://github.com/mikcnt/aml-project): building and training from scratch a model able to colorize b&w images using Deep Learning. Based on the paper [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) by Zhang et al.
* Image denoising ([Encoder-Decoder](https://github.com/mikcnt/cv-denoising-encoder) & [DCGAN](https://github.com/mikcnt/cv-denoising-gan)): two different approaches for the image denoising problem: encoder-decoder CNN vs DCGAN.
* [Search Engines](https://github.com/mikcnt/adm-homework-3): scraping Goodreads and building a search engine on top of its data.
* [HyperLogLog and Clustering](https://github.com/mikcnt/adm-homework-4): implementation of HyperLogLog and K-Means clustering. Analysis of their performance.
* [Wikicat hyperlink graph, PageRank](https://github.com/mikcnt/adm-homework-5): implementation of the PageRank algorithm on top of a reduced version of the Wikipedia hyperlinks graph.
