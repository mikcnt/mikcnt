### Hey everybody 🖖

I'm Michele Conti, MSc student in computer science @ La Sapienza, Rome.

I'm mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning, but I honestly love learning new things in general. Computer science is obviously not the only interest I've got, I'm also interested in mathematics (for which I've got a bachelor degree 🎓).

### What I'm working on 👨🏻‍💻
I'll keep here a short list of interesting projects I've been working (or I'm still working) on:

* [Image colorization with Deep Learning](https://github.com/mikcnt/aml-project): building and training from scratch a model able to colorize b&w images using Deep Learning. Based on the paper [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) by Zhang et al.
* [Image denoising with Deep Learning](https://github.com/mikcnt/cv-denoising-encoder): synthetization of artificial noise to simulate path tracing + implementation of a deep autoencoder to denoise low sampled path traced images.
* [GANs for trading](https://github.com/EmaMerca/GANs-for-trading): synthetic trading agent based on generative adversarial networks for the stock market simulation ABIDES.
