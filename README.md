### Hey everybody :v:

I'm Michele Conti, I'm currently a MSc student in computer science @ La Sapienza, Rome.

I'm mainly focused on machine learning/deep learning, but I honestly love learning new things in general! CS is not actually the only interest I've got, I'm also interested in mathematics (for which I've got a bachelor degree :P), and I also like reading stuff. I mean, stuff! Everything. And I'm still a kid who's reading Harry Potter for the 10th time! âš¡

I'll keep here a short list of interesting projects I've been working on:

* [Image colorization with Deep Learning](https://github.com/mikcnt/aml-project): building and training from scratch a model able to colorize b&w images using Deep Learning. Based on the paper [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) by Zhang et al.
* [Search Engines](https://github.com/mikcnt/adm-homework-3): scraping Goodreads and building a search engine on top of its data.
* [HyperLogLog and Clustering](https://github.com/mikcnt/adm-homework-4): implementation of HyperLogLog and K-Means clustering. Analysis of their performance.
* [Wikicat hyperlink graph, PageRank](https://github.com/mikcnt/adm-homework-5): implementation of the PageRank algorithm on top of a reduced version of the hyperlinks graph.
